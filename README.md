Basic scripts for Installation of yay+powerpill and then my custom packages, along with installing a few flatpak packages. Rudementary script that I've beautified (?). Only the packages.txt and flatpak_packages.txt need to be modified to the users requirement.


I Will be providing a brief description about all the scripts once I think I am done.
